From 2014-2019 I ran S1 with Felisha Ledesma. S1 is a non-profit center for contemporary art. It has always been artist-run and focused on community engagement. We learned a lot doing this for 5 years, but it was time to move on. 

This archive represents the programs during this time. Some things are incomplete. Some things never got documented. Some things never made it on this list and are only memories. That's how it goes.
